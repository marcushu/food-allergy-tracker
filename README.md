This (web) app help log foods consumed and analyze any resulting reactions that may be the result of food sensitivity.  Store what was eaten, and how you're feeling
on that day.  The settings allow you to adjust an offset - the number of days between eating something and the experienced
reaction - and identify a pattern.  Logged meals can be sorted according to sypmtom level.
